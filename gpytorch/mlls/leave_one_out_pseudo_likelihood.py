class LeaveOneOutPseudoLikelihood(ExactMarginalLogLikelihood):
    r"""
    The leave one out cross-validation (LOO-CV) likelihood from RW 5.4.2 for an exact Gaussian process with a
    Gaussian likelihood. This offers an alternative to the exact marginal log likelihood where we
    instead maximize the sum of the leave one out log probabilities :math:`\log p(y_i | X, y_{-i}, \theta)`.

    Naively, this will be O(n^4) with Cholesky as we need to compute `n` Cholesky factorizations. Fortunately,
    given the Cholesky factorization of the full kernel matrix (without any points removed), we can compute
    both the mean and variance of each removed point via a bordered system formulation making the total
    complexity O(n^3).

    The LOO-CV approach can be more robust against model mis-specification as it gives an estimate for the
    (log) predictive probability, whether or not the assumptions of the model is fulfilled.

    .. note::
        This module will not work with anything other than a :obj:`~gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood`
        and a :obj:`~gpytorch.models.ExactGP`. It also cannot be used in conjunction with
        stochastic optimization.

    :param ~gpytorch.likelihoods.GaussianLikelihood likelihood: The Gaussian likelihood for the model
    :param ~gpytorch.models.ExactGP model: The exact GP model

    Example:
        >>> # model is a gpytorch.models.ExactGP
        >>> # likelihood is a gpytorch.likelihoods.Likelihood
        >>> loocv = gpytorch.mlls.LeaveOneOutPseudoLikelihood(likelihood, model)
        >>>
        >>> output = model(train_x)
        >>> loss = -loocv(output, train_y)
        >>> loss.backward()
